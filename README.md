GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players in each round
- On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of their ROUND scores get lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game!
